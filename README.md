# m2k-firmware (left-handed)

This is a fork of the m2k-firmware, except the mouse buttons are swapped in hardware. This means that the primary mouse button is the right mouse button, and vice-versa. This is useful if you have the right mouse button as your primary click, and where some games (such as VALORANT) don't respect the setting in Windows control panel.
